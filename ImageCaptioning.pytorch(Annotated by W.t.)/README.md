# ImageCaptioning.pytorch

This is an image captioning codebase in PyTorch. If you are familiar with neuraltalk2, here are the differences compared to neuraltalk2.
- Instead of using random split, we use [karpathy's train-val-test split](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/caption_datasets.zip).
- Instead of including the convnet in the model, we use preprocessed features. (finetuneable cnn version is in the branch **with_finetune**)
- Use resnet instead of vgg; the feature extraction method is the same as in self-critical: run cnn on original image and adaptively average pool the last conv layer feature to fixed size .
- Much more models (you can check out models folder). The latest topdown model can achieve 1.07 Cider score on Karpathy's test split with beam size 5.

## Requirements
Python 2.7 (because there is no [coco-caption](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) version for python 3)
PyTorch 0.2 (along with torchvision)

You need to download pretrained resnet model for both training and evaluation. The models can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtbVYzOURMdDNHSGM), and should be placed in `data/imagenet_weights`.


## Pretrained models
Pretrained models are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7fNdx_jAqhtcXp0aFlWSnJmb0k). And the performances of each model will be maintained in this [issue](https://github.com/ruotianluo/neuraltalk2.pytorch/issues/10).

If you want to do evaluation only, then you can follow [this section](#generate-image-captions) after downloading the pretrained models.

## Train your own network on COCO

### Download COCO dataset and preprocessing

First, download the coco images from [link](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download). We need 2014 training images and 2014 val. images. You should put the `train2014/` and `val2014/` in the same directory, denoted as `$IMAGE_ROOT`.

Download preprocessed coco captions from [link](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/deepimagesent/caption_datasets.zip) from Karpathy's homepage. Extract `dataset_coco.json` from the zip file and copy it in to `data/`. This file provides preprocessed captions and also standard train-val-test splits.

Once we have these, we can now invoke the `prepro_*.py` script, which will read all of this in and create a dataset (two feature folders, a hdf5 label file and a json file).

```bash
$ python scripts/prepro_labels.py --input_json data/dataset_coco.json --output_json data/cocotalk.json --output_h5 data/cocotalk
$ python scripts/prepro_feats.py --input_json data/dataset_coco.json --output_dir data/cocotalk --images_root $IMAGE_ROOT

```

`prepro_labels.py` will map all words that occur <= 5 times to a special `UNK` token, and create a vocabulary for all the remaining words. The image information and vocabulary are dumped into `data/cocotalk.json` and discretized caption data are dumped into `data/cocotalk_label.h5`.

`prepro_feats.py` extract the resnet101 features (both fc feature and last conv feature) of each image. The features are saved in `data/cocotalk_fc` and `data/cocotalk_att`, and resulting files are about 200GB.

(Check the prepro scripts for more options, like other resnet models or other attention sizes.)

**Legacy:** previously we extract features into separate npy/npz files for each image, but it would be slower to load on some NFS and also to copy them around. We now save all the features in h5 file. If you want to convert from previous npy/npz files to h5 file, you can use run

```bash
$ python scripts/convert_old.py --input_json data/dataset_coco.json --fc_input_dir data/cocotalk_fc/ --att_input_dir data/cocotalk_att/ --fc_output_dir data/cocotalk_fc --att_output_dir data/cocotalk_att/
```

**Warning**: the prepro script will fail with the default MSCOCO data because one of their images is corrupted. See [this issue](https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2/issues/4) for the fix, it involves manually replacing one image in the dataset.

### Start training

```bash
$ python train.py --id st --caption_model show_tell --input_json data/cocotalk.json --input_fc_dir data/cocotalk_fc --input_att_dir data/cocotalk_att --input_label_h5 data/cocotalk_label.h5 --batch_size 10 --learning_rate 5e-4 --learning_rate_decay_start 0 --scheduled_sampling_start 0 --checkpoint_path log_st --save_checkpoint_every 6000 --val_images_use 5000 --max_epochs 25
```

The train script will dump checkpoints into the folder specified by `--checkpoint_path` (default = `save/`). We only save the best-performing checkpoint on validation and the latest checkpoint to save disk space.

To resume training, you can specify `--start_from` option to be the path saving `infos.pkl` and `model.pth` (usually you could just set `--start_from` and `--checkpoint_path` to be the same).

If you have tensorflow, the loss histories are automatically dumped into `--checkpoint_path`, and can be visualized using tensorboard.

The current command use scheduled sampling, you can also set scheduled_sampling_start to -1 to turn off scheduled sampling.

If you'd like to evaluate BLEU/METEOR/CIDEr scores during training in addition to validation cross entropy loss, use `--language_eval 1` option, but don't forget to download the [coco-caption code](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) into `coco-caption` directory.

For more options, see `opts.py`. 

**A few notes on training.** To give you an idea, with the default settings one epoch of MS COCO images is about 11000 iterations. After 1 epoch of training results in validation loss ~2.5 and CIDEr score of ~0.68. By iteration 60,000 CIDEr climbs up to about ~0.84 (validation loss at about 2.4 (under scheduled sampling)).

## Generate image captions

### Evaluate on raw images
Now place all your images of interest into a folder, e.g. `blah`, and run
the eval script:

```bash
$ python eval.py --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --image_folder blah --num_images 10
```

This tells the `eval` script to run up to 10 images from the given folder. If you have a big GPU you can speed up the evaluation by increasing `batch_size`. Use `--num_images -1` to process all images. The eval script will create an `vis.json` file inside the `vis` folder, which can then be visualized with the provided HTML interface:

```bash
$ cd vis
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Now visit `localhost:8000` in your browser and you should see your predicted captions.

### Evaluate on Karpathy's test split

```bash
$ python eval.py --dump_images 0 --num_images 5000 --model model.pth --infos_path infos.pkl --language_eval 1 
```

The defualt split to evaluate is test. The default inference method is greedy decoding (`--sample_max 1`), to sample from the posterior, set `--sample_max 0`.

**Beam Search**. Beam search can increase the performance of the search for greedy decoding sequence by ~5%. However, this is a little more expensive. To turn on the beam search, use `--beam_size N`, N should be greater than 1.

## Miscellanea
**Using cpu**. The code is currently defaultly using gpu; there is even no option for switching. If someone highly needs a cpu model, please open an issue; I can potentially create a cpu checkpoint and modify the eval.py to run the model on cpu. However, there's no point using cpu to train the model.

**Train on other dataset**. It should be trivial to port if you can create a file like `dataset_coco.json` for your own dataset.

**Live demo**. Not supported now. Welcome pull request.
